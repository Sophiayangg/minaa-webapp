## Description

The **MiNAA Web App** is a wrapper around [MiNAA](https://github.com/solislemuslab/minaa) built with R Shiny for the purpose of simplifying and enhancing user interaction with it. When complete, this app will be live at [https://minaa.wid.wisc.edu](/).

**MiNAA** is a standalone program which aligns a pair of given networks on the basis of their topological and biological data. Follow the instructions in [MiNAA's Repository](https://github.com/solislemuslab/minaa) to run MiNAA locally in the terminal.
